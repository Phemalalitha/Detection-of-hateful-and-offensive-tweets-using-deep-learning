This repository implements a multilingual hate speech detection system that automatically classifies Twitter content as Hate or Non-Hate across English, Hindi, and Telugu, with strong support for code-mixed Indian social media text. The project addresses real-world challenges such as informal language, slang, emojis, and multilingual usage commonly found on Twitter by building a robust and scalable NLP pipeline.

The system evaluates multiple modeling approaches, including Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest), Deep Learning models (BiLSTM, 1D CNN), and Transformer-based architectures such as mBERT, Distil-mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and HateBERT. Experimental results show that transformer models outperform traditional methods due to their superior contextual and multilingual understanding, making them well-suited for hate speech detection in diverse linguistic settings.

To enhance transparency and trust, the project integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients to interpret model predictions and highlight influential words in each decision. By combining multilingual data, advanced transformer models, and explainability methods, this repository provides a reliable and interpretable framework for automated hate speech moderation on social media platforms.
